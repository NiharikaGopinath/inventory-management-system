# inventory-management-system
Project made for Software Engineering and Project Management Course during my fourth semester at University.
The software was built using Python (Tkinter package).
It is aimed at solving the warehouse issues of small retail shops.
There are two modes of user access: Admin mode and User mode.
As an admin, one gets to check the inventory, add/remove product, search for a particular product, and identify the most and least profitable products sold.
In the general user mode, one can view the entire inventory or search for a particular produc.
